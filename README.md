# whack-a-suga
An one page HTML game for Module 2: Creative Computing for the CU Boulder INFO 1201 â€“ Computational Reasoning I course.

## Rules
You have ten seconds to gain as many points as possible. Gain two points for hitting a Suga and lose one point for hitting a volleyball.

## "Hack" It
The way the game is set up makes it very difficult to get more than 5 points. Students should remix the Javascript code to make it so they can easily get 20 points in 10 seconds.
